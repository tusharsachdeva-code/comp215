It runs the “git” version control system to track all changes made to a project over time. Colab and GitHub play (relatively) nicely together, so this is a perfect opportunity to start using GitHub, and start building your own portfolio of code projects.  To start, watch this [What is GitHub?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBy1zgt0XPc) video.\n",

You will complete all your work in your *fork*.  You will **not** need to do a *pull request* to *merge* your changes because you will be submitting work in your *fork*.

These notebooks are easy to distribute on the web and can be viewed and executed without any additional software installation or configuration, making them an ideal platform for sharing research and analysis. They are widely used in scientific computing and in data science applications where the emphasis is on using code to clearly communicate rather than building an end-user app.  Interactive Python notebooks use the file extension `.ipynb` instead of `.py`.  \n",

You can find more information about the Markdown language at [markdownguide.org](https://www.markdownguide.org).
